
When you compile this on the command line you must compile it correctly.
In GCC you would compile it like this:

gcc  vector-use-example vector.c 

the first c file is the main file the second is the vector file
this is a must do in c as there is no easy way to import code.
feel free to find a better solution to this but this will work for now.

a.exe is a precompiled example of vector-use-example.c
